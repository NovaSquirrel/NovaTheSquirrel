Nova the Squirrel
============

[Nova the Squirrel](http://wiki.novasquirrel.com/Nova%20the%20Squirrel) is an NES game that stars [Nova Storm](http://wiki.novasquirrel.com/Nova%20Storm), a green squirrel, who winds up in a new and unfamiliar world with strange new abilities, and she must use her new abilities to save the world. This game is supposed to give her a backstory, and portrays all the events leading up to her becoming a princess and founding [Toasterland](http://wiki.novasquirrel.com/Toasterland).

In addition to creating a rad game, the goal of this project is to develop the [Princess Engine](http://wiki.novasquirrel.com/Princess%20Engine) (named because its goal is similar to [President](http://pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=President) ) into something that's useful for other programmers to use to make their own NES platformer game. This engine will provide something much more legal to play with than hacking a game in the Mario series. In addition, unlike with Super Mario World, all the tools as well as the game itself are completely open source, and GPL licensed.
