<1 SIGN>Hold B to run, or press B to attack. From the pause menu you can choose to run with a double-tap instead, allowing you to attack while moving.
`end

:Tutorial2:
`scene NOVA_SIGN_KEE
<1 SIGN>Some enemies can have their abilities copied. Try stunning this enemy with B and then press Up+B while facing it to copy its ability.
<1 SIGN>Hold Select to get rid of the ability you have. If an enemy throws projectiles, it is usually copyable.
<0 NOVA_YAY>Oooo, I should see if copying this enemy will let me shoot fireballs!
`end

:Tutorial3:
`scene NOVA_SIGN_KEE
<1 SIGN>You can jump down from this white colored platform. Stand on it and then hold Down.
<0 NOVA>White platform? Like in the third Super M-
<2 KEE>Yes. Shhhh.
`end

:Tutorial4:
`scene NOVA_SIGN_KEE
<1 SIGN>Use Up to grab onto a ladder or Down to drop down onto it from the top.
<2 KEE>Yeah Nova, show off your rad climbing skills.
`end

:Tutorial5:
`scene NOVA_SIGN_KEE
<1 SIGN>Many abilities have altered behavior if you hold Up or Down while you press B. Try holding up while shooting a fireball and see if you can hit this enemy.
<0 NOVA>Still no idea what we're doing here, but I guess I'll find out if I press on? Eventually?
<2 KEE>Alright, while you're doing that I'm going to try and figure things out on my own.
`end

:FirstSchemeTeamEncounter:
`scene NOVA_AND_BAD_GUYS_AND_IKE
<0 NOVA>Oh, finally some other people! Could you tell me where I am?
<1 S_TEAM>No, but you'd make great target practice before we take off with this cat here.
<3 IKE>Actually, you're going to leave this cat right here. I need to get back to my shop!
<0 NOVA_MAD>Oh you want a fight? I'll give you a fight...
`end

`scene TWO_BAD_GUYS
[]The Scheme Team members flee.
<0 S_TEAM>Ouch. That squirrel isn't as weak as she seemed. We need to tell the boss so we can take care of this.
<0 S_TEAM>Hey Science Guy???
`scene BAD_GUYS_AND_LEADER
<2 BILL>What? Why do you guys look beat-up?
<0 S_TEAM>There's this weird green squirrel that totally kicked our butts, without even having a gun. Is that going to pose a threat to the plans?
<2 BILL>No, probably not. We'll just send the Smiloids after her if it becomes a problem.
<0 NOVA>There. Are you okay?
`scene NOVA_AND_IKE
<1 IKE>I'm fine, thank you. My name's Ike, and I run the item shop. The Scheme Team was trying to kidnap me so I couldn't sell items to any heroes.
<0 NOVA>The Scheme Team? Are there more of those guys?
<1 IKE>Yeah, tons. They recently broke out of prison and everyone's in a panic.
<0 NOVA>I'll see what I can do to help. By the way, how do I get to your shop?
<1 IKE>Just press Start on the level select screen. You can exit a level and go to it via the pause menu.
<1 IKE>By the way, since you asked, this world is named Latte. Good luck, dude.
`end

:AfterFirstBattle:
`scene FORUMS
[]-halp I've been taken-
[SHERWIN]Let's make the best of my situation. I'm stuck here, so how about I leak out information on what the Scheme Team is doing?
[KOREY]That could help. Are you saying you've got something to share?
[SHERWIN]Yes! I heard there was a fight with some weird green squirrel? She totally kicked some Scheme Team members' butts.
[KOREY]Oh good! Do you know where she is? Or where -you- are?
[SHERWIN]I got taken to Atomic Videoclip Zone so I'll assume that's their base. The squirrel seemed to be heading to Bummer Club.
[KOREY]I'll meet up with her there.
[]Korey rushes to the scene, introduces himself and explains Latte's situation to Nova. They chat a bit.
`scene NOVA_AND_KOREY
<1 KOREY>... and this is the Scheme Team's second try at taking over, but this time they're prepared for anything any Latte residents can throw at them.
<0 NOVA>Point being that I have a chance because I'm not from here?
<1 KOREY>Exactly. I know it's dangerous, but are you willing to help us? I don't know how you and Kee got here, but once this is over I'll try and get you two home.
<0 NOVA>I'll have to try. I was able to save Ike, maybe I can save the rest of you.
<1 KOREY>Great. Latte has its own forum, and we've been keeping track of the situation on it. You should look at it.
<0 NOVA>Alright. What should I do next?
<1 KOREY>You should go through this clubhouse up ahead. It's named Bummer Club, and it's got a prize locked up at the very end.
`end

:MeetLia:
`scene NOVA_AND_LIA
<0 NOVA_WOW>Oh it's Lia! I haven't seen you in forever.
<1 LIA>Das me! I was teleported here while looking for yous.
<0 NOVA>Maybe you can help me out on these puzzles.
<1 LIA>Okies! I'd be happy to!
`end

:SmiloidAtBummerClub:
`scene NOVA_AND_SMILOID
<2 S_TEAM>Hey squirrel! Your adventure stops here!
<1 SMILOID>Have a nice day!!!! Prepare to die! Also do NOT shoot me three times.
<0 NOVA_WOW>Lia, run!
[LIA]Aaa, way ahead of you there, Nova!
<2 S_TEAM>Don't worry, we're only interested in taking out *you*.
`end

:AfterSmiloidAtBummerClub:
`scene NOVA_AND_SMILOID
<2 S_TEAM>Oh is that so? Then we'll just have to build a bigger and stronger model!! Then you're toast!
<0 NOVA_SILLY>Yeah, we'll see about that.
`end

:NovaAndEclipse:
`scene NOVA_AND_ECLIPSE
<0 NOVA>Wow, Eclipse is here too? Is this where everyone went to?
<1 LIA>Apparently?
<2 ECLIPSE>Oh wow. Hi, sis!
<0 NOVA>Hiii! So, what do I get for completing Bummer Club?
<2 ECLIPSE>Oh, it's pretty rad! I'm awarding you some cool pants.
<0 NOVA_STRAIGHT>...What?
<2 ECLIPSE>Specifically, Nuclear Power Pants. They'll come in handy later on, and make you more powerful. I'm not making this up.
<0 NOVA>Alright, thank you, Eclipse.
`end

:JustGotPants:
`scene FORUMS
[]-halp I've been taken-
[NOVA_SILLY]Hey guys. I just got through Bummer Club and all I have to show for it are these new pants, hahaha. Where should I go next?
[KOREY]Hey, Nuclear Power Pants are NOT a laughing matter.
[SHERWIN]I dunno I'm kind of laughing right now.
[KOREY]Anyway, head over to Frozen Volcano. Just trust me on this - I thnk it's really important that you get some Fa-a-ancy cola.
[NOVA]What's so fancy about it?
[KOREY]No, it's fa-a-ancy. Completely different. Anyway, in Frozen Volcano, there's this dude named MolSno. He has a real problem so he bought every single can of fa-a-ancy cola there is and you'll just have to get some from him.
[NOVA]Sure, I guess I'll try that. But why cola?
[KOREY]I'll let you in on a little secret - the name Latte comes from the latte caffeinated drink, and in this world caffeine is a really powerful thing, especially in the hands of a squirrel.
`end

:ColaSigns:
[]-halp I've been taken-
`scene FORUMS
[NOVA]You know maybe the reason MolSno went crazy and bought all the cola is because the volcano he lives in is covered with cola advertisements.
[SHERWIN]You think so?
[NOVA]I think I'm about to see him... hopefully he cooperates?
[SHERWIN]"Molten Snow", eh? That's just a fancy name for water isn't it?
`end

:MolSnoMeet:
`scene NOVA_AND_MOLSNO
<0 NOVA>Hey I assume you're MolSno? I need some of your fa-a-ancy cola so I can save the world. Surely you can spare some cans?
<1 MOLSNO>No way, I'm safe in this volcano. This cola is all mine, every last can.
<0 NOVA_AW>MolSno, do we really have to do this? I don't want to fight you.
<1 MOLSNO>You know what? You can have my cans... the empty ones!
`end

:MolSnoAfterFight:
`scene NOVA_AND_MOLSNO
<1 MOLSNO>Okay, sure, I guess you can have some cola.
<0 NOVA>Thank you.

:NovaLiaLWSS:
`scene NOVA_AND_LIA
<0 NOVA>Oh hey, it's Lia again!
<1 LIA>Heya Nova! Remember those weird pixelly things back in Bummer Club?
<0 NOVA>The gliders and lightweight spaceships?
<1 LIA>Yeahs! Watch this, I've been experimenting with the gliders...
[]Lia sets down three glider guns, setting them to fire into the same spot in exactly the right way... and a rideable lightweight spaceship appears.
<1 LIA>Dere, you can ride this into the bad guys' headquarters.
<0 NOVA>Uhh, are you sure it's safe?
<1 LIA>Should be!
[]Nova hops onto the spaceship and it takes off! It flies a pretty long distance, seemingly without any problems...
[]... but eventually gets hit by a stray glider, causing the ship to disintegrate and causing the squirrel to fall into a rather strange place.
`scene NOVA_ALONE
>0 NOVA_STRAIGHT<Aaaaa, okay, I had no idea it was that fragile! I'll go see what the forums think I should do.
[]-halp I've been taken-
`scene FORUMS
[NOVA]The ship I was taking into the Scheme Team's headquarters broke. Now I'm stranded in some weird place.
[KOREY]Broke? Nova, remember when I said they were prepared for anything that Latte could throw at them? I meant it.
[NOVA]So they were already expecting that and sent out that glider? Figures.
[SHERWIN]Well, hopefully you can get to Atomic Videoclip Zone soon! The Scheme Team are doing some really strange things.
[SHERWIN]They have one of those spinner things that make animal noises, but I think it's some sort of secret doomsday device. OR maybe they're just trying to throw us off. That sounds likely too.
[KOREY]Are you hurt from the fall, Nova?
[NOVA]Nah, but now I need to find a way out. The landscape here is really strange.
[KOREY]Uh oh, that's probably the World of Insanity. Yeahhh, you'll want to get out of there as soon as you can.
`end

:SmiloidAtWOI:
`scene NOVA_AND_SMILOID
<2 S_TEAM>We made the Smiloids better and stronger and now we're pretty sure we'll win.
<1 SMILOID>Have a nice day! Or maybe a bad one hahaha.
<0 NOVA>Nope! I'm still going to win.
`end

:AfterSmiloidAtWOI:
`scene NOVA_AND_SMILOID

<0 NOVA>Hi, I'm Nova. Whatcha doing here?
<1 REMY>Ay, I'mma bounty huntin' space squirrel, an' I've been lookin' for work 'ere.
<0 NOVA_WOW>SPACE squirrel? So I imagine you have a cool ship?
<1 REMY>Ya, d'ya need ta' get somewhere?
<0 NOVA>Yes actually. Do you think you could get me to Atomic Videoclip Zone?
<1 REMY>Sure. Nothin' betta ta' do.
[]The two of them get into Remy's spaceship, which is much more stable than a LWSS, and fly to Atomic Videoclip Zone safely. Remy slips off to do whatever.
<0 NOVA>Okay, now this is the right place. Alright, Remy, wanna go with me to go save the world?
`scene NOVA_ALONE
<0 NOVA_AW>... Remy?
<1 REMY>Oh, my bad, I juss met dis genie guy, an' he promised ta' grant "butt wishes" an' I dunno what he means, buuuut dat sounds more fun, so seeya!

<0 NOVA>Remy! Fine, I'll go by myself.
`end

`scene NOVA_ALONE

[]Nova drinks the F-a-ancy cola and equips the Nuclear Power Pants in preparation for the battle, then nervously walks through the door...

<1 BILL>So, you managed to get all the way here? Looks like I'm going to have to take you down myself!
`scene NOVA_AND_BILL
<0 NOVA_MAD>Not a chance, giant floating head guy!

`end

`scene NOVA_ALONE
<0 NOVA_WOW>W-wow, did I really just win?
[]Having defeated Bill and the Scheme Team, Nova then finally frees Sherwin.
`scene NOVA_AND_SHERWIN
<1 SHERWIN>Thank you for rescuing me! I always believed in you, Nova.
[]Korey also shows up.
`scene NOVA_SHERWIN_KOREY
<2 KOREY>Latte will be eternally grateful. Are you ready to go home?
<0 NOVA>Actually, I'm not. I want to keep having adventures, and all of my friends are here with me.
<2 KOREY>I figured you'd say that. Well in that case I have something to show you~

[]Korey takes Nova to a room with a small space ship in the middle
[KOREY]Nova, this is the MV Explorer. It can take you to other worlds.
[NOVA_WOW]Wow, was this what you were going to use to take me home?
[KOREY]Yeah, but I'm giving it to you. There are a bunch of worlds in need of help.

It is a video game world,

ruled by a guy named Korey.

One day, it was attacked by

the "Scheme Team," a robot

army with a thirst for

destruction and power.

When it seemed hopeless,

Henceforth, replying to any

in an immediate arrest.

Yes, this has seriously

Too late? What sort of harm

that kind of harmless fun?

`nl
Remember, the Scheme Team

has Smiloids with them, and

these highly dangerous bots
`nl
derive their power from
`nl
that kind of behavior.

If they become too powerful

they will break out of jail

kidnap a man named Sherwin
