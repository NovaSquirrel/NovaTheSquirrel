:Intro:
`scene NOVA_AND_KEE
[]A fox and a squirrel used to play together in a forest, having become quite the unlikely pair of friends.
[]However, one day the squirrel got taken to a lab, which the fox attempted to rescue her from.
[]The fox accidentally damaged the lab equipment, and after a big flash of light the two of them ended up in another world.
<0 NOVA_WOW>Hey Kee? What just happened? Where are we?
<1 KEE>Not sure, Nova. You look pretty different now though.
<0 NOVA_WOW>Am I? You're different too. Hey, there's a sign over there, maybe it'll have useful information.
`scene NOVA_KEE_SIGN
<0 NOVA>Okay, let's see...
<2 SIGN>Welcome to the tutorial! You have ended up in Caffie, a video game world. These signs will explain how to play.
`end

:Tutorial1:
`scene NOVA_SIGN_KEE
<1 SIGN>First, the controls: A to jump, like most games. However, B can either be a tail attack or run, based on if you're walking or not. Don't step on the spikes.
`end

:Tutorial2:
`scene NOVA_SIGN_KEE
<1 SIGN>Some enemies can have their abilities copied. Try stunning this enemy with B and then press Up+B while facing it to copy its ability.
<1 SIGN>Hold Select to get rid of the ability you have. If an enemy throws projectiles, it is usually copyable.
`end

:Tutorial3:
`scene NOVA_SIGN_KEE
<1 SIGN>You can jump down from this white colored platform. Stand on it and then hold Down.
<0 NOVA>White platform? Like in the third Super M-
<2 KEE>Yes. Shhhh.
`end

:Tutorial4:
`scene NOVA_SIGN_KEE
<1 SIGN>Use Up to grab onto a ladder or Down to drop down onto it from the top.
<2 KEE>Yeah Nova, show off your rad climbing skills.
`end

:Tutorial5:
`scene NOVA_SIGN_KEE
<1 SIGN>Many abilities have altered behavior if you hold Up or Down while you press B. Try holding up while shooting a fireball and see if you can hit this enemy.
<1 SIGN>That should be everything you need to get started. Keep heading forward until you get to Bummer Club. Good Luck!
<0 NOVA>Okay then! Still dunno what I'm doing here.
<2 KEE>*I'm* going to go back and explore some more. I think I saw a hut back there. You should go on through this door though.
`end

:Nice_Announcement:
`scene FORUMS
[KIERAN]New announcement for the Caffieverse:
[KIERAN]Henceforth, replying to any post with nothing more than the word "nice" or a loopholed "you think you're being witty but you're not" variation of it will result in an immediate arrest. Yes, this has seriously become this large of a problem and it's going to stop.
[KIERAN]This law also covers Smiloids, those super dangerous robots that shoot people while wishing them a NICE day. I honestly don't know why they haven't been banned until now. With the recent event where the robot Scheme Team army tried to kill everyone we really need to tighten up on security around here. I'm just glad the two Blaster Guys were able to take care of things, but no one knows where they are now, so we can't just rely on them to save us. I have also IP banned the Scheme Team from our forums, just in case.
[]Meanwhile...
`scene TWO_BAD_GUYS
<0 S_TEAM>So one of the Blaster Guys is around here, right? We'd better capture him so that he can't interfere with the plans, now that we've broken out of jail and stuff.
<1 S_TEAM>Yeah, let's go do that. Also let's pretend to be cops.
<0 S_TEAM>GOOD idea. Hey, I think he's over there checking his mail!!
<0 SHERWIN>Oh it's a fine day. *checks mail* 
`scene SHERWIN_ALONE
<0 SHERWIN>Whoa, could you two maybe knock?
`scene SHERWIN_WITH_BAD_GUYS_AS_POLICE
<2 S_TEAM>You're coming with us!!
<0 SHERWIN>Wait, am I being arrested? Hi police guy!
<1 S_TEAM>Yeah, we know who you are, you're one of the blaster guys.
<0 SHERWIN>Uh, no! I'm Sherwin actually.
<1 S_TEAM>Suuuuure. I'd recognize that beard and orange shirt anywhere.
<2 S_TEAM>We're going to lock you up forever yes you heard me FOREVER.
[]-Sherwin gets taken to the Scheme Team lair-
`transition
[SHERWIN]WELL I guess I'll go post about this on the forums. I'll create a new thread. I'll need a good name, hmmm...
`scene FORUMS
[]-halp I've been taken-
[SHERWIN]yeah so these robot guys with guns just took me. this is illegal you know!
[KIERAN]omg they must be the scheme team
[SHERWIN]maybe??
[KIERAN]I *JUST* arrested those idiots, and they're already out again. great! Well I guess we're doomed now!
`end


:FirstSchemeTeamEncounter:
`scene NOVA_AND_BAD_GUYS
<0 NOVA>Oh hey, do you know how to get to Bummer Club from here?
<1 S_TEAM>Oh look, target practice!!
<0 NOVA_AW>W-wait! That's not nice!
<1 S_TEAM>We're the Scheme Team, we're not supposed to be nice, and you're going down!!
<0 NOVA_MAD>Oh, is that how it's going to be? Fine, I'll fight you, but you're going to lose~
`end

:FirstSchemeTeamEncounterAfter:
`scene TWO_BAD_GUYS
<0 S_TEAM>Ouch. We're going to have to do something about that squirrel, because she could take our entire operation down if she wanted. We need to tell the boss.
`transition
<0 S_TEAM>Hey Bill???
`scene BAD_GUYS_AND_LEADER
<2 BILL>What? Why do you guys look beat-up?
<0 S_TEAM>There's this weird green squirrel that might be an issue for us. She was able to kick our butts, and she seems stronger than the Blaster Guys were and she doesn't even have a gun. She went on towards Bummer Club afterwards, not sure what she's doing.
<2 BILL>Well, she won't be a problem for much longer. We'll just send the Smiloids after her when they're done.
`end

:AfterFirstBattle:
`scene FORUMS
[]-halp I've been taken-
[SHERWIN]So, I guess one benefit to being stuck here with the bad guys is I get to leak out information on whatever they're doing. They can't read this forum, right?
[KIERAN]They're IP banned. Anyone else can read it though.
[SHERWIN]Anyway, I heard there was a fight with some weird green squirrel? She totally kicked some Scheme Team members' butts. I'll keep reporting on this.
[KIERAN]Oh good! Oh! Do you know exactly where you are? It would really help to know where their base is.
[SHERWIN]I think this place is named Atomic Videoclip Zone?? And Nova said she was going to Bummer Club.
[KIERAN]Well then, I'll be waiting for her there.
[SHERWIN]Btw guys I'm not weak and I could totally break out of here. I'm just staying so I can give you info. That's totally it.
[KIERAN]Understood.
`transition
`scene NOVA_AND_KIERAN
<1 KIERAN>Heyyy squirrel.
<0 NOVA_YAY>Oh hi!
<1 KIERAN>You probably want some answers. This is a virtual world named Caffie, and I'm Kieran, its leader. And now I'm going to be needing your help.
<0 NOVA>My help? Why me in particular?
<1 KIERAN>You know those robot guys you fought? They're members of the Scheme Team, and that evil group seems to want to take over the world or destroy it. I'm not sure, I just know they have bad intentions. We arrested them, but they broke out. They're really determined not to lose again, so they're prepared for anything anyone in Caffie could have thrown at them.
<0 NOVA>Yeah? Oh, I get it. I'm not from here, so I actually have a good chance.
<1 KIERAN>That's the logic here. Will you help? I can try and get you home once we're no longer threatened.
<0 NOVA>Of course!
<1 KIERAN>Great. This place has its own forum, and we're keeping track of the situation on there. You should go look.
<0 NOVA>Alright. I'll go register and read up on the details.
<1 KIERAN>In the meantime you should focus on getting ready for facing off against the Scheme Team while we still have time. This place, Bummer Club, is a big puzzle challenge and there's a prize waiting at the end which should help give you the advantage.

:MeetLia:
`scene NOVA_AND_LIA
<0 NOVA_WOW>Another squirrel!
<1 LIA>Heys. Oh, I think I recognize you. You were the squirrel that played with that fox, right?
<0 NOVA>Yeah, I am. Are you from that forest too? What even happened back there?
<1 LIA>Yea, I just remember a flash of light, and here I was. I wanna go home...
<0 NOVA>Oh! I could take you with me, since I'm trying to get out of here too.
<1 LIA>You dun have to do that for me.
<0 NOVA_YAY>I want to though, and besides I could use the company. I'll help you find your way home.
<1 LIA>Okies!
<0 NOVA>I'm Nova, by the way.
<1 LIA>And I'm Lia!~

<2 S_TEAM>Hey squirrel! Your adventure stops here!
<1 SMILOID>Have a nice day!!!! Prepare to die!
<0 NOVA_WOW>Lia, run!
[LIA]Aaa, way ahead of you there, Nova!
<2 S_TEAM>Don't worry, we're only interested in taking out *you*.
`end

:AfterSmiloidAtBummerClub:
`scene NOVA_AND_SMILOID
<2 S_TEAM>Oh is that so? Then we'll just have to build a bigger and stronger model!! Then you're toast!
<0 NOVA_SILLY>Yeah, we'll see about that.

:NovaAndEclipse:
`scene NOVA_AND_ECLIPSE
<0 NOVA>Another squirrel!
<1 LIA>Squirrel party!~
<2 ECLIPSE>Oh wow. Hi, Nova! 
<0 NOVA>You know me?
<2 ECLIPSE>Yeah, I'm your long-lost sister, Eclipse. Anyway, the prize for completing Bummer Club is pretty rad. I'm awarding you some cool pants.
<0 NOVA_STRAIGHT>...What?
<2 ECLIPSE>Specifically, Nuclear Power Pants. They'll come in handy later on, and make you more powerful. I'm not making this up.
<0 NOVA>Alright, thank you, Eclipse.
`end

:JustGotPants:
`scene FORUMS
[]-halp I've been taken-
[NOVA_SILLY]Hey guys. I just got through Bummer Club and all I have to show for it are these new pants, hahaha. Where should I go next?
[KIERAN]Hey, Nuclear Power Pants are NOT a laughing matter.
[SHERWIN]I dunno I'm kind of laughing right now.
[KIERAN]Anyway, head over to Frozen Volcano. Just trust me on this - I thnk it's really important that you get some Fa-a-ancy cola.
[NOVA]What's so fancy about it?
[KIERAN]No, it's fa-a-ancy. Completely different. Anyway, in Frozen Volcano, there's this dude named MolSno. He has a real problem so he bought every single can of fa-a-ancy cola there is and you'll just have to get some from him.
[NOVA]Sure, I guess I'll try that. But why cola?
[KIERAN]I'll let you in on a little secret - the name Caffie comes from caffeine, and caffeine is this really powerful thing here, especially if a squirrel uses it.
`end

:MolSnoMeet:
`scene NOVA_AND_MOLSNO
<0 NOVA>Heyyy I assume you're MolSno? I need some of your fa-a-ancy cola so I can save the world.
<1 MOLSNO>Yeah, no. This cola is all mine, all 65535 cans of it I have here. I absolutely need every single one for myself. Totally.
<0 NOVA_AW>What? Kieran told me that it was really important. Please?
<1 MOLSNO>No. Fight me! I'll throw all these empty cans at you.
<0 NOVA_SILLY>Haha, okay.
`end

:MolSnoAfterFight:
`scene NOVA_AND_MOLSNO
<1 MOLSNO>Okay, sure, I guess you can have some cola.
<0 NOVA>Thank you. Don't be so unreasonable next time!

:NovaLiaLWSS:
`scene NOVA_AND_LIA
<0 NOVA>Oh hey, it's Lia again!
<1 LIA>Heya Nova! Remember those weird pixelly things back in Bummer Club?
<0 NOVA>The gliders and lightweight spaceships?
<1 LIA>Yeahs! Watch this, I've been experimenting with the gliders...
[]Lia sets down three glider guns, setting them to fire into the same spot in exactly the right way... and a rideable lightweight spaceship appears.
<1 LIA>Dere, you can ride this into the bad guys' headquarters.
<0 NOVA>Uhh, are you sure it's safe?
<1 LIA>Should be!
[]Nova hops onto the spaceship and it takes off! It flies a pretty long distance, but eventually gets hit by a stray glider... causing the ship to disintegrate and causing the squirrel to fall into a rather strange place.
`scene NOVA_ALONE
>0 NOVA_STRAIGHT<Aaaaa, okay this isn't the headquarters. Ugh, I'll go post on the forums, and see if I can find out where I am.
[]-halp I've been taken-
`scene FORUMS
[NOVA_MAD]The ship I was taking into the Scheme Team's headquarters broke. Now I'm stranded in some weird place.
[SHERWIN]WHAT? Well, hopefully you can get to Atomic Videoclip Zone soon! The Scheme Team are doing some really strange things.
[SHERWIN]They have one of those spinner things that make animal noises, but I think it's some sort of secret doomsday device. OR maybe they're just trying to throw us off. That sounds likely too.
[KIERAN]Are you hurt from the fall, Nova?
[NOVA]Nah, but now I need to find a way out. The landscape here is really strange.
[KIERAN]Uh oh, that's probably the World of Insanity. Yeahhh, you'll want to get out of there as soon as you can.
[LIA]Ohhh, sorry Nova! I didn't actually fully test it first, I was so eager to help...
[NOVA]It's okay, and hopefully I find someone who can give me a ride.

<1 REMY>Ya, d'ya need ta' get somewhere?
<0 NOVA>Yes actually. Do you think you could get me to Atomic Videoclip Zone?
<1 REMY>Sure. Nothin' betta ta' do.
[]The two of them get into Remy's spaceship, which is much more stable than a LWSS, and fly to Atomic Videoclip Zone safely. Remy slips off to do whatever.
<0 NOVA>Okay, now this is the right place. Alright, Remy, wanna go with me to go save the world?
`scene NOVA_ALONE

<0 NOVA>I'm actually unsure, I've got friends here and all...
<2 KIERAN>You're very popular with Caffie residents. Actually, one of them said he'd grant you a free wish... I think his name was Jafguar?

[]-Epilogue-
Nova, with the help of a wish, went on to found the kingdom of Toasterland as a nation of cute animals like herself, ruling as its princess. She decided her friends needed a place to live that didn't have monsters running around everywhere. Sherwin made a second home there, and a lot of cuties decided to move there.
