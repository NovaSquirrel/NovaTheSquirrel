:Tutorial1:
`scene NOVA_SIGN_KEE
<1 SIGN>Hold B to run, or press B to attack. From the pause menu you can choose to run with a double-tap instead, allowing you to attack while moving.
<2 KEE>Okay Nova, I have no idea where we are. Everything's so weird, and WE'RE so different now...
<0 NOVA>We'll figure it out. There's bound to be other people here who can get us home, at least? I hope.
`end

:Tutorial2:
`scene NOVA_SIGN_KEE
<1 SIGN>Some enemies can have their abilities copied. Try stunning this enemy with B and then press Up+B while facing it to copy its ability.
<1 SIGN>Hold Select to get rid of the ability you have. If an enemy throws projectiles, it is usually copyable.
<0 NOVA_YAY>Oooo, I should see if copying this enemy (to the right) will let me shoot fireballs!
`end

:Tutorial3:
`scene NOVA_SIGN_KEE
<1 SIGN>You can jump down from this white colored platform. Stand on it and then hold Down.
<0 NOVA>White platform? Like in the third Super M-
<2 KEE>Yes. Shhhh.
`end

:Tutorial4:
`scene NOVA_SIGN_KEE
<1 SIGN>Use Up to grab onto a ladder or Down to drop down onto it from the top.
<2 KEE>Yeah Nova, show off your rad climbing skills.
`end

:Tutorial5:
`scene NOVA_SIGN_KEE
<1 SIGN>Many abilities have altered behavior if you hold Up or Down while you press B. Try holding up while shooting a fireball and see if you can hit this enemy.
<0 NOVA>Still no idea what we're doing here, but I guess I'll find out if I press on? Eventually?
<2 KEE>Alright, while you're doing that I'm going to try and figure things out on my own.
`end

:FirstSchemeTeamEncounter:
`scene NOVA_AND_BAD_GUYS_AND_IKE
<0 NOVA>Oh, finally some other people! Could you tell me where I am?
<1 S_TEAM>No, but you'd make great target practice before we take off with this cat here.
<3 IKE>Actually, you're going to leave this cat right here. I need to get back to my shop!
>0 NOVA_AW<I'd better help him!
`end

:FirstSchemeTeamEncounterAfter:
`scene TWO_BAD_GUYS
[]The Scheme Team members flee.
<0 S_TEAM>Ouch. That squirrel isn't as weak as she seemed. We need to tell the boss so we can take care of this.
`scene BAD_GUYS_AND_LEADER
<0 S_TEAM>Hey William???
<2 BILL>What? Why do you guys look beat-up?
<0 S_TEAM>There's this weird green squirrel that totally kicked our butts, without even having a gun. Is that going to pose a threat to the plans?
<2 BILL>No, probably not. We'll just send the Smiloids after her if it becomes a problem.
`scene NOVA_AND_IKE
<0 NOVA>There. Are you okay?
<1 IKE>I'm fine, thank you. My name's Ike, and I run the item shop. The Scheme Team was trying to kidnap me so I couldn't sell items to any heroes.
<0 NOVA>The Scheme Team? Are there more of those guys?
<1 IKE>Yeah, tons. They recently broke out of prison and everyone's in a panic.
<0 NOVA>I'll see what I can do to help. By the way, how do I get to your shop?
<1 IKE>It's a menu option on the screen between levels.
<1 IKE>By the way, since you asked, this place is named Latte. Good luck, dude.
[]Completing this level will open up world 2. Press up/down on the level select screen to swap between worlds.

:AfterFirstBattle:
`scene FORUMS
[]-halp I've been taken-
[SHERWIN]Let's make the best of my situation. I'm stuck here, so how about I leak out information on what the Scheme Team is doing?
[KOREY]That could help. Are you saying you've got something to share?
[SHERWIN]Yes! I heard there was a fight with some weird green squirrel? She totally kicked some Scheme Team members' butts.
[KOREY]Oh good! Do you know where she is? Or where -you- are?
[SHERWIN]I got taken to Atomic Videoclip Zone so I'll assume that's their base. The squirrel's near the end of the forest.
[KOREY]I'll meet up with her there.
`scene NOVA_AND_KOREY
[]Korey rushes to the scene, introduces himself and explains Latte's situation to Nova. They chat a bit.
<1 KOREY>... and this is the Scheme Team's second try at taking over, but this time they're prepared for anything any Latte residents can throw at them.
<0 NOVA>Point being that I have a chance because I'm not from here?
<1 KOREY>Exactly. I know it's dangerous, but are you willing to help us? I don't know how you and Kee got here, but once this is over I'll try and get you two home.
<0 NOVA_AW>Well I can't just let the bad guys win if I'm the one who can stop them!
<1 KOREY>Great. Latte has its own forum, and we've been keeping track of the situation on it. You should look at it.
<0 NOVA>Alright. What should I do next?
<1 KOREY>You should go through this clubhouse up ahead. It's named Bummer Club, and it's got a prize locked up at the very end.
`end

:MeetLia:
`scene NOVA_AND_LIA
<0 NOVA_WOW>Oh it's Lia! I haven't seen you in forever.
<1 LIA>Das me! I was teleported here while looking for yous.
<0 NOVA_YAY>Maybe you can help me out on these puzzles.
<1 LIA>Okies! I'd be happy to!
`end

:LiaChat2:
`scene NOVA_AND_LIA
<1 LIA>I fink you need to build a pathway up to those computer chips, and get all of 'em to progress.
<0 NOVA>Build? With what?
<1 LIA>Springs! For dis level you've got a bunch of 'em in your inventory. Blocks too, but springs are betters! They're on a second page in yer inventory!
`end

:LiaChat3:
`scene NOVA_AND_LIA
<0 NOVA>Do you think we'll ever get home?
<1 LIA>I fink so! We'll figure it outs. I dunno about yous but but I fink this is pretty fun!
<0 NOVA_YAY>I suppose it is! Maybe we should stick around anyway...
`end

:FHBGAtBummerClub:
`scene NOVA_AND_SMILOID
<2 S_TEAM>Hey squirrel! Your adventure stops here!
<1 SMILOID>Have a nice day!!!!
<0 NOVA_WOW>Lia, run!
[LIA]Aaa, way ahead of you there, Nova!
<2 S_TEAM>Oh this Smiloid won't be fighting you. Instead we've hired the very best, Forehead Block Guy!
[LIA]Hmm, I fink he's actually safe to touch, only his blocks aren't. Good luck Nova!
`end

:AfterFHBGAtBummerClub:
`scene NOVA_AND_SMILOID
<2 S_TEAM>Oh, you got past him? W-we'll figure out how to take you down, just you wait!
<0 NOVA_SILLY>Yeah, we'll see about that.
<0 NOVA>Wonder where that prize is. I guess it's past that door?
`end

:JustGotMirror:
`scene NOVA_AND_ECLIPSE
<0 NOVA_YAY>Wow, I didn't know I'd be running into Eclipse here too!
<2 ECLIPSE>Mhm! I was asked to guard the prize for whoever gets through the puzzles, and it seems like you have?
<0 NOVA_WOW>Yeah, what do I get?
<1 LIA>It'll probably be like, some sort of cool pants or something.
<0 NOVA>Or "essence of forehead block".
<2 ECLIPSE>Uh, no! Actually I'm awarding you this mysterious Mirror Scepter.
<0 NOVA_YAY>Whoa, what's it do?
<2 ECLIPSE>It can reflect things. I heard the leader of the Scheme Team was originally defeated by reflecting his own projectiles into himself!
<0 NOVA>Alright, thank you, Eclipse.
<1 LIA>I'm gonna go off and work on some mad science... I've got some ideas. Seeya Nova!
`scene FORUMS
[]-halp I've been taken-
[NOVA]Alright, I got through Bummer Club, what else should I get? I wanna make sure I've got as much of a chance as I can.
[SHERWIN]Probably the cola?
[KOREY]Yeah, head over to Frozen Volcano. Just trust me on this - I think it's really important that you get some Fa-a-ancy cola.
[NOVA]What's so fancy about it?
[KOREY]No, it's fa-a-ancy. Completely different. Anyway, in Frozen Volcano, there's this dude named MolSno, short for "Molten Snow". He has a real problem so he bought every single can of fa-a-ancy cola there is and you'll just have to get some from him.
[NOVA]Sure, I guess I'll try that. But why cola?
[KOREY]I'll let you in on a little secret - the name Latte comes from the latte caffeinated drink, and in this world caffeine is a really powerful thing, especially in the hands of a squirrel.
[SHERWIN]Haha yeah, squirrels already tend to be pretty hyper even without any help from coffee!
[]Nova travels to Frozen Volcano, the land of lava and ice.
`end

:ColaSigns:
`scene FORUMS
[]-halp I've been taken-
[NOVA_SILLY]You know maybe the reason MolSno went crazy and bought all the cola is because the volcano he lives in is covered with cola advertisements.
[SHERWIN]You think so?
[NOVA]I think I'm about to see him... hopefully he cooperates?
[SHERWIN]"Molten Snow", eh? That's just a fancy name for water isn't it?
`end

:MolSnoMeet:
`scene NOVA_AND_MOLSNO
<0 NOVA>Hey I assume you're MolSno? I need some of your fa-a-ancy cola so I can save the world. Surely you can spare some cans?
<1 MOLSNO>No way, I'm safe in this volcano. This cola is all mine, every last can.
<0 NOVA_AW>MolSno, do we really have to do this? I don't want to fight you.
<1 MOLSNO>You know what? You can have my cans... the empty ones!
`end

:MolSnoAfterFight:
`scene NOVA_AND_MOLSNO
<1 MOLSNO>Okay, sure, I guess you can have some cola.
<0 NOVA>Thank you.
`scene FORUMS
[]-halp I've been taken-
[NOVA]Okay, so now I've got the cola and the sceptor. Am I all set?
[KOREY]Yeah, now you've just gotta figure out how to get to the Scheme Team headquarters.
[SHERWIN]I don't think you'll be able to JUST walk here. You'll need something better.
[LIA]Oh I know! I've got an idea and I'm gonna meet up with Nova and help her!
[KOREY]Er, well, okay, if you're sure!
`end

:JohnMeet:
`scene NOVA_AND_JOHN
<1 JOHN>I'll be honest here, I just wanted to be a boss so badly that I didn't care WHICH team I was on.
<0 NOVA_SILLY>Well congratulations, you're on the losing one.
<1 JOHN>Just give me this fight, okay?
<0 NOVA>Ha, sure thing.
`end

:JohnAfterFight:
`scene NOVA_AND_JOHN
<0 NOVA>Where'd you learn to do THAT?
<1 JOHN>Oh, I have a whale friend who does something sort of like that.
`end


:NovaLiaLWSS:
`scene NOVA_AND_LIA
<0 NOVA>Oh hey, it's Lia again!
<1 LIA>Heya Nova! Remember those weird pixelly things back in Bummer Club?
<0 NOVA>The gliders and lightweight spaceships?
<1 LIA>Yeahs! Watch this, I've been experimenting with the gliders...
[]Lia sets down three glider guns, setting them to fire into the same spot in exactly the right way... and a rideable lightweight spaceship appears.
<1 LIA>Dere, you can ride this into the bad guys' headquarters.
<0 NOVA>Uhh, are you sure it's safe?
<1 LIA>Should be!
`scene NOVA_ALONE
[]Nova hops onto the spaceship and it takes off! It flies a pretty long distance, seemingly without any problems...
<0 NOVA_YAY>Weee, I'm going so fast. Wait, what's that?
[]... but eventually gets hit by a stray glider, causing the ship to disintegrate and causing the squirrel to fall into a rather strange place.
>0 NOVA_WOW<Aaaaa, okay, I had no idea it was that fragile! I'll go see what the forums think I should do.
`scene FORUMS
[]-halp I've been taken-
[NOVA]Er, the ship Lia made for me broke.
[KOREY]Made? Uh oh. Nova, those ships aren't very stable.
[NOVA_SILLY]Well I can see that -now-. Guess I'll have to find another ride around here.
[SHERWIN]Well, hopefully you can get to Atomic Videoclip Zone soon! The Scheme Team are doing some really strange things.
[SHERWIN]They have one of those spinner things that make animal noises, but I think it's some sort of secret doomsday device. OR maybe they're just trying to throw us off. That sounds likely too.
[KOREY]Are you hurt from the fall, Nova?
[NOVA]Nah, I don't take fall damage, but I've still gotta get to my destination! This place is pretty weird...
[KOREY]Uh oh, that's probably the World of Insanity. Definitely try to find a ride out of there!
`end

:BeforeFighterMaker:
`scene BAD_GUYS_AND_LEADER
<2 BILL>Okay we need to bring out the big guns if we want to stop this squirrel. Maybe this fighter I just made will do the trick?
<0 S_TEAM>You just made a fighter out of thin air?
<2 BILL>Yes, thanks to this software I just found!
`scene NOVA_ALONE
<0 NOVA_WOW>... What is that thing? Why's it coming after me? ... Oh, it must be another boss.
`end

:AfterFighterMaker:
`scene NOVA_ALONE
<0 NOVA>That was a strange fight.
[BILL]Crap, she got past the freak! I remember what Jack told me, when there's a problem there IS a solution.
[BILL]CAN DO, WILL DO!
`end

:BeforeJack:
`scene NOVA_ALONE
[]A large plastic man appears, calling himself Jack. He raises himself and Nova into the air for a battle in the sky!
<0 NOVA_AW>What the heck?
`end

:AfterJack:
`scene NOVA_ALONE
<0 NOVA>Oof, I'm back on solid ground again.
[BILL]Ugh, more like Can't Do, Won't Do.

:MeetRemy:
`scene NOVA_AND_REMY
<0 NOVA>Hi, I'm Nova. Whatcha doing here?
<1 REMY>Ay, I'mma bounty huntin' space squirrel, an' I've been lookin' for work 'ere.
>0 NOVA_WOW<Four squirrels in one game? Amazing.
<0 NOVA_WOW>SPACE squirrel? So I imagine you have a cool ship?
<1 REMY>Ya, d'ya need ta' get somewhere?
<0 NOVA>Yes actually. Do you think you could get me to Atomic Videoclip Zone?
<1 REMY>Sure. Nothin' betta ta' do.
>0 NOVA<Fingers crossed!
[]The two of them get into Remy's spaceship, which is much more stable than a LWSS, and fly to Atomic Videoclip Zone safely. Remy slips off to do whatever once they arrive.
`scene NOVA_ALONE
<0 NOVA>Hey, we made it! And I bet a cool bounty hunter squirrel could be a big help in saving this world.
<0 NOVA_AW>... Remy?
`scene NOVA_REMY_JAFGUAR
<1 REMY>Oh, my bad, I juss met dis genie guy, an' he sounds more fun than this 'saving the world' thing, so seeya.
<2 JAFGUAR>Yeah who cares?
<0 NOVA>Well then, maybe I really am supposed to do it alone. Bye, I guess?
`scene FORUMS
[NOVA]Going in! Wish me luck! You know, for an evil headquarters, I was expecting something... darker? These enemies sure are shooty though!
[KOREY]Yeah, but if you copy them, YOU can be the shooty one!
`end

:BeforeBill:
`scene FORUMS
[NOVA]Alright, I'm just about to face off with the final boss! When I take him down, this'll all be over, right?
[KOREY]Yup! And then I can take you home. Sorry for making you go through all of this for us...
[SHERWIN]You can do it! I wanna get out of here so badly!
[IKE]Good luck!
[NOVA]Thank you everyone! I'll do my best!
[LIA]'kay Nova! I think he's gonna go all out, and he might be too strong... BUT remember the legend of how he was defeated last time?
[NOVA]By reflecting his projectiles back into himself?
[LIA]Yus! I fink dat's the key to victory. Take dat mirror scepter and show him not to mess with a squirrel!
`scene NOVA_ALONE
>0 NOVA_AW<Here it is, the final battle. I've gotta give my best shot.
[]Nova drinks the F-a-ancy cola and equips the Mirror Scepter in preparation for the battle, then nervously walks through the door...

<2 KOREY>Latte will be eternally grateful. Are you ready to go home?
<0 NOVA>Actually, I'm not. I want to keep having adventures, and all of my friends are here with me.
<2 KOREY>I figured you'd say that. Well in that case I have something to show you~
`scene NOTHING
[]Korey takes Nova to a room with a small space ship in the middle
[KOREY]Nova, this is the MV Explorer. It can take you to other worlds. You can forge your own destiny and decide what you want to do with your ability.
[NOVA_WOW]Wow, was this what you were going to use to take me home?
[KOREY]Yeah, but I'm giving it to you. There are a bunch of worlds in need of help.

<1 KEE>Hey Nova, congrats! I went off on my own adventure while I was gone.
<0 NOVA>Hi Kee! Nice to see you again. What's up?
<1 KEE>Turns out I'd been gifted the ability to use fire magic, but after a lot of scorched fur and minor burns I realized I needed a teacher. I found a wizard in a broken-down hut.
<0 NOVA>And he taught you?
<1 KEE>Yes, he helped me learn how to use my magic. He was very elderly and he passed away before he could finish, but he left me his books and supplies and I finished by myself.
<0 NOVA>Still eager to go home?
<1 KEE>Eh, who cares at this point? Everything seems a lot more interesting here, but I'd love to go on an adventure with you later!

:; INTRO CUTSCENE TEXT

:ExpositionText1:
The world of Latte lived
`nl
in peace for many years.
`nl
It is a video game world,
`nl
ruled by a guy named Korey.
`end

:ExpositionText2:
One day, it was attacked by
`nl
the "Scheme Team," a robot
`nl
army with a thirst for
`nl
destruction and power.
`end

:ExpositionText3:
When it seemed hopeless,
`nl
the Double Action Blaster
`nl
Guys showed up and blasted
`nl
their way to victory.
`end

:ExpositionText4:
The Scheme Team was stopped
`nl
and arrested, but the Guys
`nl
disappeared shortly after.
`nl
Latte was now vulnerable.
`end

:ExpositionText5:
-Korey-
`nl
Henceforth, replying to any
`nl
post with nothing more than
`nl
the word "nice" will result
`nl
in an immediate arrest.
`end

:ExpositionText6:
-Korey-
`nl
Yes, this has seriously
`nl
become *this* large of a
`nl
problem and it's going to
`nl
stop, before it's too late!
`end

:ExpositionText7:
-Ike-
`nl
Too late? What sort of harm
`nl
could possibly come out of
`nl
that kind of harmless fun?
`end

:ExpositionText8:
-Korey-
`nl
Remember, the Scheme Team
`nl
has Smiloids with them, and
`nl
these highly dangerous bots
`nl
derive their power from
`nl
that kind of behavior.
`end

:ExpositionText9:
-Korey-
`nl
If they become too powerful
`nl
they will break out of jail
`nl
and we would be totally
`nl
screwed!
`end

:ExpositionText10:
(Meanwhile...)
`nl
"Well, my friends, it looks
`nl
like today will be a very
`nl
"Nice" day for us. Let's
`nl
bust out of this place!"
`end

:ExpositionText11:
The Scheme Team constructs
`nl
a fortress as well as a new
`nl
master plan. This time they
`nl
would be ready for anything
`end

:ExpositionText12:
However, in doing so they
`nl
kidnap a man named Sherwin
`nl
when they confuse him for
`nl
a Blaster Guy due to looks.
`end

:ExpositionText13:
Sherwin decides the proper
`nl
course of action is to go
`nl
make a thread on the Latte
`nl
forums about the incident.
`end

:ExpositionText14:
-Sherwin-
`nl
These robot guys with guns
`nl
just went and kidnapped me.
`nl
This is illegal, you know!
`end

:ExpositionText15:
-Korey-
`nl
Robot guys with guns? Uh...
`nl
Oh no. I think we might be
`nl
screwed after all.
`end

:ExpositionText16:
Fortunately, through random
`nl
luck a squirrel appears in
`nl
Latte. Can she fix things?
`end
