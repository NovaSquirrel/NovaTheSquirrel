:Intro:
`scene NOVA_AND_KEE
<0 NOVA_WOW>Wow, where are we? This doesn't look like the same forest...
<1 KEE>Not sure. Not sure why you're suddenly a lot taller either, and... green?
<0 NOVA_WOW>Am I? You're different too. Hey, there's a sign over there, maybe it'll have useful information.
`scene NOVA_KEE_SIGN
<0 NOVA>Okay, let's see...
<2 SIGN>Welcome to the tutorial! You have ended up in Caffie, a video game world. These signs will explain how to play.
`end

:Tutorial1:
`scene NOVA_SIGN_KEE
<1 SIGN>First, the controls: A to jump, like most games. However, B can either be a tail attack or run, based on if you're walking or not. Don't step on the spikes.
`end

:Tutorial2:
`scene NOVA_SIGN_KEE
<1 SIGN>Some enemies can have their abilities copied. Try stunning this enemy with B and then press Up+B while facing it to copy its ability.
<1 SIGN>Hold Select to get rid of the ability you have. If an enemy throws projectiles, it is usually copyable.
`end

:Tutorial3:
`scene NOVA_SIGN_KEE
<1 SIGN>You can jump down from this white colored platform. Stand on it and then hold Down.
<0 NOVA>White platform? Like in the third Super M-
<2 KEE>Yes. Shhhh.
`end

:Tutorial4:
`scene NOVA_SIGN_KEE
<1 SIGN>Use Up to grab onto a ladder or Down to drop down onto it from the top.
<2 KEE>Yeah Nova, show off your rad climbing skills.
`end

:Tutorial5:
`scene NOVA_SIGN_KEE
<1 SIGN>Many abilities have altered behavior if you hold Up or Down while you press B. Try holding up while shooting a fireball and see if you can hit this enemy.
<1 SIGN>That should be everything you need to get started. Keep heading forward until you get to Bummer Club. Good Luck!
<0 NOVA>Okay then! Still dunno what I'm doing here.
<2 KEE>*I'm* going to go back and explore some more. I think I saw a hut back there. You should go on through this door though.
`end

:Nice_Announcement:
`scene FORUMS
[KIERAN]New announcement for the Caffieverse:
[KIERAN]Henceforth, replying to any post with nothing more than the word "nice" or a loopholed "you think you're being witty but you're not" variation of it will result in an immediate arrest. Yes, this has seriously become this large of a problem and it's going to stop.
[KIERAN]This law also covers Smiloids, those super dangerous robots that shoot people while wishing them a NICE day. I honestly don't know why they haven't been banned until now. With the recent event where the robot Scheme Team army tried to kill everyone we really need to tighten up on security around here. I'm just glad the two Blaster Guys were able to take care of things, but no one knows where they are now, so we can't just rely on them to save us. I have also IP banned the Scheme Team from our forums, just in case.
[]Meanwhile...
`scene TWO_BAD_GUYS
<0 S_TEAM>So one of the Blaster Guys is around here, right? We'd better capture him so that he can't interfere with the plans, now that we've broken out of jail and stuff.
<1 S_TEAM>Yeah, let's go do that. Also let's pretend to be cops.
<0 S_TEAM>GOOD idea. Hey, I think he's over there checking his mail!!
<0 SHERWIN>Oh it's a fine day. *checks mail* 
`scene SHERWIN_ALONE
<0 SHERWIN>Whoa, could you two maybe knock?
`scene SHERWIN_WITH_BAD_GUYS_AS_POLICE
<2 S_TEAM>You're coming with us!!
<0 SHERWIN>Wait, am I being arrested? Hi police guy!
<1 S_TEAM>Yeah, we know who you are, you're one of the blaster guys.
<0 SHERWIN>Uh, no! I'm Sherwin actually.
<1 S_TEAM>Suuuuure. I'd recognize that beard and orange shirt anywhere.
<2 S_TEAM>We're going to lock you up forever yes you heard me FOREVER.
[]-Sherwin gets taken to the Scheme Team lair-
`transition
[SHERWIN]WELL I guess I'll go post about this on the forums. I'll create a new thread. I'll need a good name, hmmm...
`scene FORUMS
[]-halp I've been taken-
[SHERWIN]yeah so these robot guys with guns just took me. this is illegal you know!
[KIERAN]omg they must be the scheme team
[SHERWIN]maybe??
[KIERAN]I *JUST* arrested those idiots, and they're already out again. great! Well I guess we're doomed now!
`end


:FirstSchemeTeamEncounter:
`scene NOVA_AND_BAD_GUYS
<0 NOVA>Oh hey, do you know how to get to Bummer Club from here?
<1 S_TEAM>Oh look, target practice!!
<0 NOVA_AW>W-wait! That's not nice!
<1 S_TEAM>We're the Scheme Team, we're not supposed to be nice, and you're going down!!
<0 NOVA_MAD>Oh, is that how it's going to be? Fine, I'll fight you, but you're going to lose~
`end

`#(boss battle I guess?)
`scene TWO_BAD_GUYS
<0 S_TEAM>Ouch. We're going to have to do something about that squirrel, because she could take our entire operation down if she found out. We need to tell the boss.
`transition
`scene BAD_GUYS_AND_LEADER
<0 S_TEAM>Hey Bill???
<2 BILL>What? Why do you guys look beat-up?
<0 S_TEAM>There's this weird green squirrel that might be an issue for us. She was able to kick our butts, and she seems stronger than the Blaster Guys were and she doesn't even have a gun. She went on towards Bummer Club afterwards, not sure what she's doing.
<2 BILL>Well, she won't be a problem for much longer. We'll just send the Smiloids after her when they're done.
`end

:AfterFirstBattle:
`scene FORUMS
[]-halp I've been taken-
[SHERWIN]So, I guess one benefit to being stuck here with the bad guys is I get to leak out information on whatever they're doing. They can't read this forum, right?
[KIERAN]They're IP banned. Anyone else can read it though.
[SHERWIN]Anyway, I heard there was a fight with some weird green squirrel? She totally kicked some Scheme Team members' butts. I'll keep reporting on this.
[KIERAN]Oh good! Oh! Do you know exactly WHERE you are? It would really help to know where their base is.
[SHERWIN]I think this place is named Atomic Videoclip Zone?? And Nova said she was going to Bummer Club.
[KIERAN]Well then, I'll be waiting for her there.
[SHERWIN]Btw guys I'm not weak and I could totally break out of here. I'm just staying so I can give you guys info. That, and they would probably catch me again and I would be worse off.
[KIERAN]Understood.
`transition
`scene NOVA_AND_KIERAN
<1 KIERAN>Heyyy squirrel.
<0 NOVA_YAY>Oh hi!
<1 KIERAN>You probably want some answers. This is a virtual world named Caffie, and I'm Kieran, its leader. And now I'm going to be needing your help.
<0 NOVA>Oh yeah, I heard I would be needed around here!
<1 KIERAN>Anyway, those robot guys you fought? They're members of the Scheme Team, a big group of bad guys that seems intent on taking over the world or destroying it or whatever. I don't even know. We arrested them after they tried last time and now they're back at it. Will you help?
<0 NOVA>Yeah, of course!
<1 KIERAN>Great. This place has its own forum, and we're keeping track of the situation on there. You should go look.
<0 NOVA>Alright. I'll go register.
<1 KIERAN>In the meantime you should focus on getting ready for facing off against the Scheme Team while we still have time. This place, Bummer Club, is a big puzzle challenge and there's a prize waiting at the end which should help give you the advantage.
<0 NOVA>Oh, okay.
`end

:SmiloidAtBummerClub:
`scene NOVA_AND_SMILOID
<2 S_TEAM>Hey squirrel! Your adventure stops here!
<1 SMILOID>Have a nice day!!!! Prepare to die!
<0 NOVA_MAD>Uh, no! I'm still going to win.
`end

:AfterSmiloidAtBummerClub:
`scene NOVA_AND_SMILOID
<2 S_TEAM>Oh is that so? Then we'll just have to build a bigger and stronger model!!
`end

:NovaAndEclipse:
`scene NOVA_AND_ECLIPSE
<0 NOVA>Another squirrel!
<1 ECLIPSE>Oh wow. Hi, Nova! 
<0 NOVA>You know me?
<1 ECLIPSE>Yeah, I'm your long-lost sister, Eclipse. Anyway, the prize for completing Bummer Club is pretty rad. I'm awarding you some cool pants.
<0 NOVA_STRAIGHT>...What? 
<1 ECLIPSE>Specifically, Nuclear Power Pants. This pair will power up any explosions you make. I'm not making this up.
<0 NOVA>Alright, bigger explosions sound like they'll help. Thank you, Eclipse.
`end

:JustGotPants:
`scene FORUMS
[]-halp I've been taken-
[NOVA_SILLY]Hey guys. I just got through Bummer Club and all I have to show for it are these new pants, hahaha. Where should I go next?
[KIERAN]Hey, Nuclear Power Pants are NOT a laughing matter.
[SHERWIN]I dunno I'm kind of laughing right now.
[KIERAN]Anyway, head over to Frozen Volcano. Just trust me on this - I thnk it's really important that you get some Fa-a-ancy cola.
[NOVA]What's so fancy about it?
[KIERAN]No, it's fa-a-ancy. Completely different. Anyway, in Frozen Volcano, there's this dude named MolSno. He has a real problem so he bought every single can of fa-a-ancy cola there is and you'll just have to get some from him.
[NOVA]Sure, I guess I'll try that. But why cola?
[KIERAN]I'll let you in on a little secret - the name Caffie comes from caffeine, and caffeine is this really powerful thing here, especially if a squirrel uses it.
`end

:MolSnoMeet:
`scene NOVA_AND_MOLSNO
<0 NOVA>Heyyy I assume you're MolSno? I need some of your fa-a-ancy cola so I can save the world.
<1 MOLSNO>Yeah, no. This cola is all mine, all 65535 cans of it I have here. I absolutely need every single one for myself. Totally.
<0 NOVA_AW>What? Kieran told me that it was really important. Please?
<1 MOLSNO>No. Fight me!
<0 NOVA_SILLY>Haha, okay.
`end
`
:MolSnoAfterFight:
`scene NOVA_AND_MOLSNO
<1 MOLSNO>Okay, sure, I guess you can have some cola.
<0 NOVA>Thank you. Don't be so unreasonable next time!
`end

:NovaAndRaoul:
`scene NOVA_AND_RAOUL
<1 RAOUL>Hey, it's me, Raoul, I can get you to the Scheme Team's headquarters with this teleporter I made.
<0 NOVA>Okay, k00l, that sounds way faster than walking all the way there!
`scene BAD_GUYS_AND_LEADER
`transition
[]A little while earlier
<0 S_TEAM>Sooo some fox was going to give Nova a teleporter to get into our base. Obviously this isn't OK.
<1 S_TEAM>We already took care of it though. We sabotaged it so it's actually going to teleport her to the World of Insanity.
<2 BILL>Haha yeah hopefully she won't survive there.
`transition
`scene NOVA_AND_RAOUL
<1 RAOUL>Alright, you ready? I'll go send you on your way then.
<0 NOVA>Okay, send me to the Scheme Team's headquarters.
`transition
`scene NOVA_ALONE
>0 NOVA_MAD<Okayyyy this is NOT the right place, dumb fox. Let's see if I can get out of here.

:WrongPlace:
`scene FORUMS
[]-halp I've been taken-
[NOVA_MAD]Yeah I've been sent to the wrong place!!
[SHERWIN]WHAT? Well, hopefully you can get to Atomic Videoclip Zone soon! The Scheme Team are doing some really strange things.
[SHERWIN]They have one of those spinner things that make animal noises, but I think it's some sort of secret doomsday device. OR maybe they're just trying to throw us off. That sounds likely too.
[NOVA]I'll try. Hopefully I find someone who can help.
`end

:SmiloidAtWOI:
`scene NOVA_AND_SMILOID
<2 S_TEAM>We made the Smiloids better and stronger and now we're pretty sure we'll win.
<1 SMILOID>Have a nice day! Or maybe a bad one hahaha.
<0 NOVA>Nope, you're not going to stop this squirrelll

<1 REMY>Ya, d'ya need ta' get somewhere?

<1 REMY>Sure. Nothin' betta ta' do.

<1 BILL>So, you managed to get all the way here? Looks like I'm going to have to take you down myself!
<0 NOVA_MAD>Not a chance, giant floating head guy!

`end

`scene NOVA_ALONE
<0 NOVA_WOW>W-wow, did I really just win?
[]Having defeated Bill and the Scheme Team, Nova then finally frees Sherwin.
`scene NOVA_AND_SHERWIN
<1 SHERWIN>Thank you for rescuing me! I always believed in you, Nova.
[]Kieran also shows up.
`scene NOVA_SHERWIN_KIERAN
<2 KIERAN>Wow Nova, Caffie will be eternally grateful.
<0 NOVA_YAY>Haha yeah. I'm the hero!~
<2 KIERAN>You're very popular with Caffie residents. One of them, Jafguar said he'd grant you one free wish...
<0 NOVA_AW>Not interested in any of his "butt wishes".
<2 KIERAN>Uh, no? Regular ones! Like, maybe you want to be a princess or something.
<0 NOVA_WOW>Oh my goodness, I totally might.

[]-Epilogue-
Nova, with the help of a wish, went on to found the kingdom of Toasterland as a nation of cute animals like herself. Sherwin made a second home there, and a lot of cuties just decided to move there.
