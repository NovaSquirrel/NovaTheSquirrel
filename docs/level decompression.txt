Levels are composed of a series of commands, in this form:

 TT - Command Type
 YX - Y and X bytes. Y is absolute, X is relative from the previous block's X.
[SS]- additional optional settings bytes

The command list is composed of a command format (from the list below) and a byte for configuration.
Usually the configuration byte is a block type to use, as in BLOCK_SINGLE and BLOCK_RECTANGLE.

Command formats:

 CUSTOM_BLOCK_SINGLE     - TT XY mm
One block with any metatile type.

 CUSTOM_BLOCK_RECTANGLE  - TT XY mm WH
Rectangle with any metatile type.

 BLOCK_SINGLE            - TT XY
A single block of a hardcoded type.

 BLOCK_RECTANGLE         - TT XY WH
A rectangle of a hardcoded type.

 BLOCK_WIDE_FROM_LIST    - TT XY Wm
A rectangle (1 block tall) of a type from a list.

 BLOCK_TALL_FROM_LIST    - TT XY Hm
A rectangle (1 block wide) of a type from a list.

 BLOCK_RECT_FROM_LIST    - TT XY Hm WW
A rectangle of a type from a list.

 BLOCK_RECTANGLE_SERIES  - TT XY [WH] ... FF
A series of rectangles. One width (minus 1) and height are specified after the other.
Example (with a pit):
   222
111222       4     6666
11122233333334     6666
              \_5_/
1: $22 - width 3, height 2
2: $23 - width 3, height 3
3: $61 - width 7, height 1
4: $02 - width 1, height 2
5: $40 - width 5, height 0
6: $32 - width 3, height 2
   $FF - ending mark

---------------------------------
Command types from $f0 to $ff are special commands that don't encode any blocks.

These commands are defined:

Finished     - Stop decompressing the level
SetX         - Set the X position for the next block to an arbitrary byte
Write1Column - Sets the data for the current column to an arbitrary byte (for question block contents, etc)
Write2Column - Same, but has 2 bytes for 2 consecutive columns
Write3Column - Same, but has 3 bytes for 3 consecutive columns
XMinus16     - Sets the X position for the next block back 16 columns
XPlus16      - Sets the X position for the next block ahead 16 columns
