Levels are composed of a series of commands, in this form:

 TT - Command Type
 YX - Y and X bytes
[SS]- additional optional settings bytes

The command list is composed of a command format (from the list below) and a byte for configuration.
Usually the configuration byte is a block type to use, as in BLOCK_SINGLE and BLOCK_RECTANGLE.

Command formats:

 CUSTOM_BLOCK_SINGLE     - TT XY mm
One block with any metatile type.

 CUSTOM_BLOCK_RECTANGLE  - TT XY mm WH

 BLOCK_SINGLE            - TT XY

 BLOCK_RECTANGLE         - TT XY WH
